For the exploration of NASA space telescope exoplanet search, logistic regression and deep learning were both used in order to create models that could potentially assist in predicting the existance of the new planets. For the logistic regression, the model was trained and tested and then further tuned using GridSearchCV achieving a final best accuract score of 87.9%. In comparison, the neural network deep learning modeal was able to attain an accuracy of 89.4% with a loss score of 0.26. Both models have similar performance, with the neural network modeal being slightly more accurate. This sub 90% is reasonably accurate but still not overly so, over 1 in 10 predictions being inaccurate is not specifically predictive. In order to improve both these models' performance, they would probably benefit in receving more data for training and testing in order to increase its accuracy, as the data set has a relatively low amount of inputs compared to space and structures in the universe.
